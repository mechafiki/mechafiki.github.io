          I am an aspiring data scientist and web developer. 
          I have always been interested in computers and how they work, 
          which led me to pursue a degree in computer science. 
          After graduation, I realized that I wanted to use my skills 
          to help organizations make better decisions through data analysis. 
          And so, here I am!

          <br></br>
          I have some experience working with both Python and R 
          for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks. 
          In addition, I have developed several web applications using React. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          My goal is to continue developing my skills so that I can become a 
          well-rounded data scientist who can provide insights that drive business decisions.
